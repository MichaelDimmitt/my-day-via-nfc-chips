## My Day Via NFC Chips
NFC chips! are they the future?

Probably not ðŸ˜…, why? Because phones do not have nfc enabled by default.

However, if your phone does have nfc enabled. 

Here is something I am trying at home: (Redundancy can be a good thing!)

1) Exiting the door,  Website that has text: ( wallet, keys, phone )  CheckBoxes.
- Name of a person to be thankful for.
- Confirm, did you lock the door?
2) Going to bed, Website that has text: Brush Teeth, set out clothes 
- socks, pants, shirt shoes, hat ðŸ˜‰ 
- charge bike lights.	
3) Getting into the car. Driver seat, <br/>
- (goes to a website for 10 seconds and then, turns off the phone.)
4) Getting on the bike. (seatpost, since your phone is in the back pocket.)
- website provides list: helmet, front light, tail light, 
5) Reading a book.
6) When at work. schedule an alarm for when I should be getting ready to leave work.
